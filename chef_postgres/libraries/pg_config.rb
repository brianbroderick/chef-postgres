        # (and perhaps only 500/second even with lots of clients).
        # For situations where a small amount of data loss is acceptable in return for a large boost in how many updates you can do to the database per second,
        # consider switching synchronous commit off. This is particularly useful in the situation where you do not have a battery-backed write cache on your disk controller,
        # because you could potentially get thousands of commits per second instead of just a few hundred.
        # For obsolete versions of PostgreSQL, you may find people recommending that you set fsync=off to speed up writes on busy systems.
