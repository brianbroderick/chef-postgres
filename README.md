This cookbook is designed to make it easy to install Postgres 9.1+ on an EC2 Ubuntu instance using Chef or Amazon Opsworks version 12+.

The root recipes are chef_postgres::master and chef_postgres::standby. Set up the master first. This will create a pg_basebackup dump that is uploaded to S3 (partially using the server_name in the S3 path) along with the settings required for the recovery.conf file on the standby.

Once the master is set up, run chef_postgres::standby. This grabs the backup from S3 and uses this to deploy the standby. 

To change the default settings, pass in custom JSON.  These are the defaults:

```
{
  "chef_postgres":  {
    "server_name": "default",
    "release_apt_codename": "codename_reported_by_ec2",
    "version": "9.6",
    "workload": "oltp",
    "s3":  {
      "region": "",
      "bucket": "",
      "access_key_id": "",
      "secret_access_key": "" 
    }
  }  
}
```

For workload, the options are:

"dw" - Data Warehouse
  * Generally I/O or RAM intensive, though aggregate queries can use a lot of CPU
  * Large bulk inserts
  * Large complex reporting queries
  * Also called "Business Intelligence" or "BI"

"oltp" - Online Transaction Processing
  * Generally CPU or I/O intensive
  * DB can be slightly larger than RAM 
  * Writes are usually small
  * Some long transactions and complex read queries

"web" - Web Application
  * Generally CPU or I/O intensive
  * DB much smaller than RAM
  * Mostly simple queries

"mixed" - Mixed DW and OLTP characteristics
  * A generic workhorse

"desktop" - Not a dedicated database
  * A dev environment
